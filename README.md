# The Token Ring

This [webring](https://tokenring.monoxane.io) is an attempt to connect creatives and engineers across the Broadcast and IT industries, it aims to be a community that inspires and teaches and as such prioritizes hand made sites, wikis, and portfolios.
It was inspired by the [XXIIVV ring](https://webring.xxiivv.com/) which is a wonderful group of artists and developers, but isn't quite a group I fit in with at the moment, along with many requests (some joking, some not) by friends and internet acquaintances to bring back 2006 with a ring.

## Join the webring

```

1) Add the webring icon to your website HTML.
2) Add your website information to the [index.html](index.html) file. Keep your link name short, and don't leave a trailing `/` in the `href` attribute. Use a sensible value for the `id` attribute like your username or site name.
3) Submit a Pull Request with **the location of the webring icon** on your site. Pull requests with blank descriptions will be rejected.

Alternatively, if you your website has a light background, use `icon.light.svg`, there's also 2 with colour if you so desire.

### Webring criteria

- Your website must contain an about page with ways to contact you.
- It must have some creative, educational, or technical content that isn't just blogs.
- It must reside on it's own domain (*.github.io and similar services will be rejected), 
- Single page sites will be rejected.
- Landing pages that just shove the user off to other social platforms will be rejected.
- If your site contains violent, racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful content it will be rejected.
- Businesses will probably be rejected unless you provide services that benefit this community.
- The use of Generative AI is banned, you can get in the sea.
If your site violates this criteria after joining, you'll be removed from the ring. We will occasionally prune inactive sites from people we haven't seen in a while.

## Help

The ring is managed by [@monoxane](https://mastodon.vx0.dev/@monoxane), but a few other people in the community are able to accept and manage this index.
